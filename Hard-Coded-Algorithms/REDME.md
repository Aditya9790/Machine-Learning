Hello folks, ✌✌ in this repo I will be uploading all the Machine Learning Algorithms that will be <b>hard coded</b> developed from scratch
without the use of any liabraries like scikit or tensorflow.

I will only be using basic liabraries like : 
- numpy : For matrix manipulations
- pandas : for generation pof data frame and handeling data.
- matplotlib : For plotting the results.
- Seaborn : Liabrary for plotting of data more effeciently.
